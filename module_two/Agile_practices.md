# Agile Workflow

Both projects that I participated in, were very agile this past module. This became more agile in the second project which
I found to be awesome. We were very efficent, with the little shop project nearly done on Monday (on a four person team!).
We planned for a tiny bit every day, about 15 minutes to figure out what everyone was working on and what they had accomplished.
Then we used the waffle board to organize tasks and make sure no tasks were repeated. Lastly, this organization helped us
avoid merge conflicts, so our git workflow was nearly pristine.
