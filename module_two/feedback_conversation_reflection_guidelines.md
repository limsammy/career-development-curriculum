 # In Person Feedback
 
* Date of feedback conversation: 09/08/2017

* How did you prepare for the conversation?

I reflected mentally over the pros and cons of working with the people I worked with.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?

The conversation went very well. All three of my group members had the dynamic down and worked fluidly together.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

We were very careful not to use any violent communication, and focused on strengths and where we needed to improve.

* Any other comments:

I need to work on not cutting people off when they're talking!
